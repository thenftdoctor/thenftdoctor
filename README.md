Hi, Iâ€™m @thenftdoctor. 
By training I'm a nuclear radiologist, clinical researcher and clinical epidemiologyst (MD PhD MSc).

I enjoy learning to code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, python, R) and I'm currently following the full stack engineer learning pathway at codecademy. I love design, writing, blockchain and AI technology.
