Hi, Iâ€™m @thenftdoctor. 
By training I'm a nuclear radiologist, clinical researcher and clinical epidemiologyst (MD PhD MSc).

I enjoy learning to code (HTML, CSS, js, python, rust, R) and I'm fascinated by blockchain technology.

I'm on a mission to transform health, planning to build the first health d'app on the blockchain.
Check out my website at https://thenftdoctor.com. Read my whitepaper.
If you are a developer, cryptography or smart contract expert and want to join the project I'd love to hear from you.

You can reach out to me at: iam@thenftdoctor.com
